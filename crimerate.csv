Date,Note
"2021-04-01","On April 1, 2021, data for “Calls for service, mental health – other” from November 2019 and 2020, December 2019 and 2020, and January 2020 and 2021 for the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary were corrected. Additionally, data for “Calls for service, overdose”; “Calls for service, child welfare check”; and “Calls for service, child custody matter – domestic” for all reference periods for the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary were corrected to show as not available due to a lack of correspondence between the data reported and the selected categories."
"2020-09-10","On September 10, 2020, the data for June 2020 have been corrected for Winnipeg Police Service for assault and sexual assault violations and breakdowns."



Footnotes:
1,"The Canadian Centre for Justice and Community Safety Statistics (CCJCSS) is conducting a special survey collection from a sample of police services across Canada measuring the impact of COVID-19 on selected types of crimes and calls for service. In addition, counts of occurrences against provincial / territorial acts related to the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic were requested. Note that data for the selected violations in this table are preliminary and may differ from other data for the same reference years published from the Uniform Crime Reporting Survey as the collection processes differ. Previously published data may have been revised."
2,"Includes data reported by a sample of 19 police services across Canada for this release. At the time of this release, the Waterloo Regional Police Service was unable to provide violations data for the months of August and September 2021. Furthermore, the Montréal Police Service, Quebec Provincial Police, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Edmonton Police Service and the Winnipeg Police Service were unable to provide calls for service data for all months. Additionally, some police services may not report data for every violation type or every call type in every month. Therefore, caution should be exercised when comparing monthly totals across police services."
3,"Calls for service (CFS) are defined as calls received by police services that are citizen-generated or officer initiated, and required the tasking of police resources (e.g., a call to a 9-1-1 emergency line that resulted in the dispatch of an officer). Calls for service information was reported for selected months by 14 police services."
4,"Some police services who provided calls for service information overall were not able to report for every call type. In addition, police services in some cases were unable to separate the call types as presented, and provided counts that combine one or more call type together. For example, calls for domestic disputes may include child welfare situations, and calls for other mental health may include some Mental Health Act (MHA) apprehensions. Interpret calls for service data with caution."
5,"Provincial and Territorial Acts related to COVID-19 include occurrences where police responded to an incident related to compliance under an act related to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as a provincial public health act or an emergency measures act. Some police services who provided information overall were not able to distinguish at the time of submission whether the occurrence was related to a provincial or federal act. Some occurrences may include responses related to the Federal Quarantine Act. Note that data on police-reported violations against the Federal Quarantine Act are captured in the UCR survey and published with annual crime statistics data."
6,"Overdose counts do not reflect all overdose incidents occurring within police service boundaries as response is frequently by paramedics. Where police do not attend, the occurrence will not appear in police records."
